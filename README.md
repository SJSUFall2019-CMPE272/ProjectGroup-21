Description: By using the electoral dataset of Indian elections(1977-2015), a system can predict candidate's winning probability by analyzing the voting pattern, voters' social and economical background as well as taking into account candidate's political background.

Goal: This system can help political parties to find appropriate candidates who have higher chances of winning elections.

Alternative Approach

Description: By using the dataset of Indian election, a system can analyze voting patterns, change in the economy, poverty, GDP growth rate, and various other parameters to determine the performance of the previously elected government.

Goal: This system can help citizens to determine which was the most effective government in previous years based on data and facts. This will avoid data abuse for electoral purpose.

Note: Based on the available data we change the scope of this problem statement(country, state or district etc).
