***New Idea :***

**WhomToVote?**

*Description*: By using the electorial dataset of indian elections(1977-2015), a system can predict candidate's wining probability by analysing voting pattern, voters' social and economical background as well as taking into account candidate's political background.

*Goal*:This system can help political parties to find appropriate candidates who has higher chances of wining elections.

Alternative Approach

*Description*:By using the dataset of indian election, a system can analyze voting patterns, change in economy, poverty, GDP growth rate and various other parameters to determine performance of the previously elected goverment.

*Goal*: This system can help citizens  to determine which was the most effective government in previous years based on data and facts.

*Note*: Based on the available data we change change the scope of this problem statement(country, state or district etc).

**Technology stack
Dataset: kaggle, Harvard Dataverse
Language:Python
Visualisation: D3.js 
**

**1) Groupify**

Description:
Ever felt that during hangouts, we spend most of the time in deciding which movie to watch? With the help of Groupify, we   can solve this problem in few clicks. This application takes inputs from all the group members based on personal interests   i.e genre, cast, etc. The system applies Machine Learning on the user inputs and will recommend a common movie that a group should watch.

Goal:
The ultimate goal is to reduce the time taken in deciding which movie to watch.

Technology Stack:
Python, Machine Learning, Jupyter Notebook, sci-kit learn, public movie dataset, TBD

**2) FireFighter**

Description:
Accidental fires are more frequent in some regions as compared to others. We cannot stop the fire from happening but can      surely take action to mitigate damages caused by the fire. Using this application, we can predict areas that are susceptible to any kind of fire. Based on those predictions, fire department can decide where to place the fire stations and prevent     further loss.

Goal:
The goal is to reduce the cost and time by placing fire stations at optimum location from the vulnerable sites.

Technology Stack:
Python, Machine learning, Jupyter Notebook, Data Visualization, Accidental fires: dataset, TBD.

**3) SmartRecruiter**

Description:
Hiring proper candidate for any position does take a lot of time, cost and efforts. The aim of this project is to boost        this   initial screening and help recruiter to filter from the available candidates. A position title and related requirements will   be used to fetch appropriate candidate from the available resumes. It will then generate a report of candidates who are the most suitable for the position.

Goal:
It will reduce the time to find the appropriate candidate for the position by automating the recruitment process.

Technology stack:
Python, Character Recognition, NLP, Machine Learning.
